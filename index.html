                    <h3>My Trip to Japan</h3>
                    <img src="resources/img/japan_rooftops.JPG" alt="Rooftop view of Japan" height="250">
                    <p>
                        Recently, I visited Japan with a group of my friends. The trip was an amazing experience, and I learned so much about the culture there. 
                        I can't wait to visit again!
                        I took nearly 4,000 photos during the trip. The photo displayed here captures the view from a rooftop bar in Tokyo, overlooking the cityscape.

                    <h3>Camera I Used</h3>
                    <img src="resources/img/sony_rx100vii.webp" alt="Sony RX100 VII camera" height="250">
                    <p>
                        I brought two cameras on the trip, my Sony RX100 VII and my Canon G7X Mark III. Both are compact and excellent for travel photography.
                        Initially, I used the Canon G7X Mark III for most of my shots, but I quickly realized that the Sony RX100 VII's autofocus was faster and more reliable, which was particularly beneficial when capturing spontaneous moments.
                        As a result, I switched to using the Sony RX100 VII for the majority of my photography during the trip.
                        In addition to the quality of the images, I found the Sony's video capabilities superior, allowing me to capture high-quality videos of my experiences as well.
                        Going forward, I plan to primarily use the Sony RX100 VII for travel photography and videography due to its excellent performance and versatility.

                    <h3>Kyoto Gyoen National Garden</h3>
                    <video src="resources/video/kyoto_nature.MOV" controls width="250"></video>
                    <p>
                        This is a video of the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden. 
                        It showcases the natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere of the garden, highlighting the greenery and traditional Japanese landscaping.
                        I captured this video during my visit to Kyoto. 
                        It was a peaceful change of pace from Osaka, allowing me to immerse myself in nature. 
                        Even though I had my camera with me, I decided to capture the scene with my phone.
