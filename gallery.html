                    <p>
                        This photo was taken during my trip to Japan in Tokyo. 
                        A rather simple photo, but it brings back great memories of the trip.

                    <h2>Arashiyama Boat</h2>
                    <a><img src="resources/img/japan_highlight2.JPG" alt="Boat floating in Water" height="250"></a>
                    <p>
                        A visually pleasing photo for me. Arashiyama is a district on the western outskirts of Kyoto, Japan.
                        The peacefulness of the boat floating on the water is captivating.
                        I remember taking this photo after returning from the Iwatayama Monkey Park.

                    <h2>Japanese Bowing Deer</h2>
                    <a><img src="resources/img/japan_highlight3.JPG" alt="Japanese Bowing Deer" height="250"></a>
                    <p>
                        This photo was taken in Nara, Japan. Nara is known for its friendly deer that roam freely around the city.
                        These deer are considered sacred and are a popular attraction for tourists.
                        I was fortunate enough to capture this deer staring directly into the camera. 
                        The deer bowing is a common behavior when they expect food from visitors. essence of Japan for me: a blend of natural beauty and urban life.

                    <h2>Japanese Teishoku</h2>
                    <a><img src="resources/img/japan_highlight4.JPG" alt="Japanese Teishoku" height="250"></a>
                    <p>
                        This photo was taken in Kyoto, Japan. 
                        Teishoku is a type of Japanese set meal that typically includes a main dish, rice, miso soup, and several side dishes.
                        I enjoyed this meal at a small local restaurant in Kyoto. The presentation and variety of dishes made it a memorable dining experience.

                    <h2>Japanese Bathroom Art</h2>
                    <a><img src="resources/img/japan_highlight5.JPG" alt="Japanese Bathroom Art" height="250"></a>
                    <p>
                        This photo was taken inside a bathroom stall at a restaurant in Osaka, Japan.
                        I found the drawings on the stall to be unique and funny. The artwork depict a meme heiarchy of a man. 
                        The first drawing is simple, the second is a more detailed version and points back to the first iteration with an arrow labeling it "noob".
                        The final drawing is an exaggerated cartoon face with an arrow pointing to itself labeled "Ryotsu".
                        Ryotsu is a popular manga/anime character in Japan, making the drawing even more amusing to me.

                <article id="japan-cat">
                    <h2>Japanese Cat</h2>
                    <a><img src="resources/img/japan_highlight6.JPG" alt="Cute Cat with grey-blue eyes and fluffy fur!" height="250"></a>
                    <p>
                        This is my favorite photo in the gallery. 
                        While exploring a food market in Osaka, we came across this cat resting quietly near a planter. 
                        Its fluffy beige fur and soft gray-blue eyes immediately stood out, giving it a calm but slightly alert look. 
                        The cat seemed comfortable in its surroundings, watching people pass by without much concern. 
                        I instinctively pulled out my camera and took the photo. I love cats!
