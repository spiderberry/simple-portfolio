                <p>
                    My portfolio is a reflection of my dual interests in technology and the arts. 
                    These highlights are a mix of projects I’ve worked on throughout my time as a Computer Science student, ranging from software development to creative photography. 
                    Some projects began as academic assignments, while others are personal ideas I’ve continued to refine outside the classroom. 
                    Many of these projects are still evolving, and this page serves as a snapshot of that process.

                        This project is an employee managament system which allows user to manage employee records and generate reports. 
                        Users are able to search for employees using SSN, Name or employee ID. 
                        It offers the ability to add, update, and delete employees, as well as mass update salary by various filters. 
                        Java and MySQL were used to develop the application, providing a robust and user-friendly interface for efficient employee management with a MySQL backend. 
                        The application was developed over a month.

                        Even though not particulary impressive creatively in any aspect, this remains one of my favorite photos that I've taken. 
                        This photo was taken during my trip to Japan in Osaka at a nightclub. 
                        I have no idea who the person in the photo is,  but I love the energy and vibe that it captures of the nightlife in Osaka.
                        As the story goes, my friends and I were having a ball in the night club. People would randomly come up to us and start dancing with us.
                        Me being the photographer of the group, I was taking pictures of my friends enjoying themselves when this random guy came up and started dancing in front of the lens. 
                        I quickly snapped this photo and was able to capture the energy of the moment.

                        This project is still in development. 
                        It is a web-based game that simulates track and field events, allowing users to compete in various athletic challenges. 
                        The game aims to provide an engaging and interactive experience for sports enthusiasts.
                        Basketball-GM was used as inspiration for this project, as well as my own interest in track and field. 
                        Initially I started this project in 2021, using Java as the main programming language. 
                        However, I have since transitioned to using web technologies to make the game more accessible, utilzing Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML, and CSS.
