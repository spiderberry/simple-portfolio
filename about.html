                <h2>Biography</h2>

                <p>I grew up bouncing between New Jersey and Georgia, moving back and forth throughout my childhood. 
                    New Jersey is where I spent most of my formative years, finishing high school and starting my college journey. 
                    Those years shaped my social life and are where I made some of my happiest memories. 
                    However, in 2022, I moved back to Georgia due to my parents relocating here.

                <img src="resources/img/gsu_logo.jpg" alt="Georgia State University Logo" height="100">
                <p>I am computer science student at Georgia State University with a passion for technology and innovation. 
                    I enjoy working on passion projects, solving complex problems, and continuously improving my skills. 
                    My expected graduation date is Decemeber 2026. 
                    As of now, I've taken software development, operating systems, data structures, Calculus II and the foundations of computer science courses. 
                    I'm currently taking Web Programming, Computer Organization and Architecture, Linear Algebra, and Applied Probability and Statistics for Computer Science. 
                    After this semester, I plan to take Software Engineering, Mobile App Development, Databases, and Cloud Computing.
                </p>

                <p>At Georgia State University, I have built the foundation of my programming skills, moving from the foundations of computer science into specialized application. 
                    This academic journey has allowed me to enjoy solving complex problems and given me the confidence to build independent projects. 
                    Currently, I am focusing on Web Programming and getting hands-on experience with full-stack development. 
                    I am constantly expanding my abilities, with plans to dive into Mobile App Development and Cloud Computing in upcoming semesters. 
                    My goal is to round out my expertise as a versatile software engineer before my expected graduation in December 2026.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                <p>Even though I spent my formative years in New Jersey, it wasn't until I moved to Georgia that many of my hobbies fully developed.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <img src="resources/img/osaka.JPG" alt="Osaka shopping district" height="250">
                <p>
                    I had always been fascinated by photography, spending hours researching film point-and-shoots, but it never went beyond a passive interest. 
                    After moving to Georgia, I revisited photography with a new perspective. I started with a disposable camera, eventually graduating to a thrifted Vivitar ZM80. 
                    I carried that bulky camera everywhere, developing a style that focused on candid, genuine shots. 
                    Over time, my interest shifted toward the high-contrast, early-2000s aesthetic. 
                    This led me to explore older digital cameras, eventually landing on the Ricoh GR Digital series, which became my go-to for that vintage "paparazzi" look. 
                    Photography has since become my favorite way to capture moments as they happen.
                </p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <img src="resources/img/FL_Studio_2014.webp" alt="FL Studio 2014 Logo" height="250">
                <p>
                    Music followed a similar path. 
                    Growing up during the SoundCloud era, artists like Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert inspired me with their confidence, creativity, and energy. 
                    I started by freestyling over type beats and eventually taught myself how to produce using FL Studio. 
                    After moving to Georgia, music became a creative outlet during a period when I was rebuilding my social life. 
                    I spent a lot of time improving my vocal mixing and refining my sound. 
                    While I release music quietly, mostly for myself, it remains a personal outlet rather than a pursuit of fame or money.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nowadays, I get a lot of inspiration from artists like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eGScySZZmw"><em>Yeat</em></a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw_XFnk5kwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PinkPantheress</em></a>,
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toJgX41iafQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lucki</em></a>,
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlwBZ2MSNtE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fisher</em></a>, and 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9mTSekTktw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rauw Alejandro</em></a>.
                </p>

               <p>Here is one of my favorite songs by PinkPantheress:</p>

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <img src="resources/img/japan_random_guy.JPG" alt="Random Guy in Japan" height="250">
                <p>
                    Traveling wasn’t always a major interest of mine, even though I grew up around it. 
                    That changed after a post-high school road trip across California, which taught me that travel is most fun when shared and centered on exploration.
                    Since moving to Georgia, travel has become an even bigger part of my life. 
                    Visiting cities such as London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Valencia completely shifted my perspective. 
                    Experiencing different cultures, styles, food, and ways of life made me realize how much exists beyond my immediate surroundings.
                    Most recently, a trip to Japan and South Korea helped me clarify what I value in a future homebase: 
                    walkable cities, strong public transportation, and a social lifestyle.
                    Travel has become my favorite way to learn, reset, and spend meaningful time with friends.
